A turn-based strategy game, similar to Advance Wars. This project aims to be an easy-to-use testbed for AI programmers. The project offers a game server, a default (dumb) AI client and a default visualization client (observer).

The core game code can easily be used to build a custom server or client. The default game database contains all Advance Wars 2 units and most of it's terrain types, but it is easily swapped for a custom database.

The game supports both Python level files and .aws files, which can be built with the Advance Wars Series Map Editor (http://www.advancewarsnet.com/designmaps/editor.php).
