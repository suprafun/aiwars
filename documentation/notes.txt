server:

maps: playing fields
databases: unit, building and terrain rules


The server can be asked for a list of map names and a list of database names, and it can be asked to provide
map or database data for a given name.


server provides interface for client (CLIENT -> SERVER):

-- pre-game commands --
connect() -> connects this client with the server
set_mode(mode) -> mode is either 'observer' or 'player'
set_name(name) -> sets this clients name
end_turn() -> ends the turn of this client early

-- game commands --
move_unit(unit_id, route)
load_unit(unit_id, target_id, route)
unload_unit(unit_id, destination)
supply_surrounding_units(unit_id, route)
attack_unit(unit_id, target_id, route)
combine_units(unit_id, target_id, route)
build_unit(unit_type_id, building_id)
capture_building(unit_type_id, route)
end_turn()


client provides interface for server (SERVER -> CLIENT):

-- pre-game commands --
send_map_data() -> sends the chosen map data to the client
send_database_data() -> sends the unit/building/terrain data to the client
game_starts() -> signals a game start

-- game commands --
turn_starts() -> it's time for this client to play his turn
turn_ends() -> time's up for this client, his turn has ended
